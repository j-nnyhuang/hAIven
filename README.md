<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

Our solution, Haiven, is a smartphone app designed to help women track their experiences with intimate partner violence. The app was envisioned as a ‘friendly neighbour’ who can overhear abusive encounters coming from next door, and check-in with the woman if they’re concerned for their safety.

Haiven automatically starts to record audio if it detects aggressive noises. Like a friendly neighbour, Haiven will check-in later in the day to make sure everything’s okay. If the audio is extremely aggressive, and Haiven is concerned for the user’s safety, an emergency contact will be immediately notified.
